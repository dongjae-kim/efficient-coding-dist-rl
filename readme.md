# Efficient coding + Dist-RL
*Please contact Dongjae Kim (dongjae.kim@nyu.edu)*

This repo contains mainly two parts of the projects

1. Verifying possibility of approximation of DA neurons' response functions (Dabney et al., 2020, Nature) with sigmoid functions.
2. ***(TODO)*** Fitting the distributional RL model to human data using M-estimator, so that can compare with the result of 1.

## Test environment
```buildoutcfg
scipy==1.4.1
numpy==latest
```
